Below is a summary of the main issue and how to fix it based on your setup with **expo-router**:

1. **Folder Structure and Route Grouping**

   You currently have:
   - A **Profile** screen in `app/(tabs)/profile.tsx`.
   - A **Bookmarks** screen in `app/bookmarks.tsx`.

   Because your `ProfileScreen` is inside the `(tabs)` group (i.e., `app/(tabs)/profile.tsx`), pushing a route at the root level (`/bookmarks`) may not work as expected unless your root layout is configured to handle that route.  

   > In expo-router, screens in different groups often need to be referenced by their full path (e.g., `/(tabs)/bookmarks`) or placed within the same route group.

2. **Why `router.push('/bookmarks')` May Fail**

   - If you have `_layout.tsx` files that create separate navigators for different route groups, the `/bookmarks` route could be “outside” the tab navigator structure.  
   - Depending on your layouts, `'/bookmarks'` might not be recognized, or the navigation tries to push onto a stack that doesn’t exist.

3. **Ways to Fix It**

   **Option A**: **Move** your `app/bookmarks.tsx` into the `(tabs)` directory so that your Bookmarks screen is under the same route grouping:
   ```plaintext
   app
   └── (tabs)
       ├── _layout.tsx
       ├── profile.tsx
       ├── bookmarks.tsx   <-- Move the file here
       ...
   ```
   Then, from `app/(tabs)/profile.tsx`, do:
   ```typescript:app/(tabs)/profile.tsx
   router.push('/(tabs)/bookmarks');
   ```
   This ensures the route is recognized within the same group.

   **Option B**: **Keep** the `bookmarks.tsx` where it is and update references/layouts so that a push to `/bookmarks` is valid in your project’s overall navigation structure. For example, if your root `_layout.tsx` renders a stack or tab navigator that includes the `bookmarks.tsx` route, then:
   ```typescript:app/(tabs)/profile.tsx
   // This may work if your root layout is set up to handle /bookmarks properly
   router.push('/bookmarks');
   ```
   Make sure you’ve cleared your Metro cache and reloaded your app so expo-router can pick up any new or changed route files.

## Example Adjusted Code

Below is a minimal example of shifting `bookmarks.tsx` into your `(tabs)` group **and** referencing it correctly from `profile.tsx`.

```typescript:app/(tabs)/profile.tsx
function ProfileScreen() {
  // ...
  const handleBookmarksPress = () => {
    // Now we navigate within the (tabs) group
    router.push('/(tabs)/bookmarks');
  };

  return (
    <View>
      {/* ... */}
      <TouchableOpacity onPress={handleBookmarksPress}>
        <Text>My Bookmarks</Text>
      </TouchableOpacity>
    </View>
  );
}
```

```typescript:app/(tabs)/bookmarks.tsx
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';
import { Stack } from 'expo-router';

export default function BookmarksScreen() {
  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1 }}>
      <Stack.Screen options={{ title: 'Bookmarks' }} />
      <Text>Bookmarks Screen</Text>
    </View>
  );
}
```

After doing this, run `npx expo start -c` to clear caches, and it should properly navigate to your bookmarks screen when you press “My Bookmarks.”
