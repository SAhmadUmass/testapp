Below is a detailed step‐by‐step plan to implement backend search for videos using Appwrite. This plan is aimed at a junior developer and breaks down the steps into atomic, manageable tasks with technical details and pseudocode where useful. No complete code is provided, but guidance and pseudocode snippets are included.

---

## 1. Confirm Full‑Text Indexes on Video Fields

• Verify that your database schema in Appwrite has full‑text indexes on the fields you want to search.  
  – In your Appwrite configuration (typically the appwrite.json file), check that:
  – The **title** field is indexed (e.g., using “title_search”).  
  – The **description** field has its own full‑text index (e.g., “desc_search”).

• If the indexes aren’t present, update the schema in Appwrite before attempting to search. This is critical for performance and accurate search results.

## 2. Extend the Video Fetching Service to Accept a Search Term

• **Critical File:**  
  – `services/videos.ts`

• Modify the signature of your video fetching function (e.g., `fetchVideos`) to accept an optional search parameter (for example, `searchText`).

• **Atomic Steps:**

  1. **Add a New Parameter:**  
   – Update the function so it accepts search-related parameters.  
   – For example, add `searchText` as an optional string parameter.

  2. **Build the Appwrite Query Dynamically:**  
   – Start by creating an array (or list) of query filters that always includes a limit, and any other filters (like cuisine and difficulty).  
   – Check if `searchText` is present. If so, incorporate the search query.
     • Use a pseudocode-style approach:
      IF searchText exists THEN  
       Add a query filter that does a full‑text search on the title and/or description fields  
       For example, combine conditions with a logical OR:
          – Query.search(‘title’, searchText)  
          – Query.search(‘desc_search’, searchText)  
       • Optionally wrap these filters in an “or” query if Appwrite supports it.

  3. **Combine Filters:**  
   – Ensure that the search filter is combined with any other filters (like filtering by cuisine or difficulty) as needed.

## 3. Integrate the Search Query Using Pseudocode

• **Pseudocode Example:**

  - Initialize an empty array for queries:
   queries = [ Query.limit(limitValue) ]
  - If filtering by cuisine or difficulty, add these with Query.equal.  
  - If searchText exists:
   – Add a filter (using something like Query.or) that combines:
    • Query.search('title', searchText)  
    • Query.search('desc_search', searchText)
  - Finally, call the Appwrite API:
   – response = databases.listDocuments(DATABASE_ID, COLLECTIONS.VIDEOS, queries)

• This pseudocode outlines the logic; ensure that the actual code adheres to the specific Appwrite query builder’s syntax and your project’s coding conventions.

---

## 4. Update Error Handling and Response Mapping

• Make sure that your try/catch block in `fetchVideos` (or a similar function) gracefully handles:
  – Any errors coming from the Appwrite API.
  – Returns an empty video array or an error message if needed.

• Map the returned documents from Appwrite to your application’s video interface (e.g., `VideoPost`) as you currently do in the mapping step.

---

## 5. Document and Test the Search Functionality

• **Documentation:**  
  – Update technical documentation or inline comments to explain the new search functionality and how the search queries are constructed.  
  – Explain the usage of the full‑text indexes for both title and description fields.

• **Testing:**  
  – Test cases should include:
    • Issuing search requests with various keywords  
    • Verifying that results include videos where the keyword is found in the title and/or description  
    • Ensuring that when no search term is provided, all videos (filtered by other parameters if any) are returned.

• **Critical Files to Test:**  
  – `services/videos.ts` (backend search logic)  
  – Any integration points (for instance, the feed screen using search parameters passed from a search modal)

---

## 6. Consider Future Enhancements

• **Advanced Querying:**  
  – In the future, you might want to add support for multiple keywords, fuzzy matching, or even ranking based on relevance. For now, a basic combination of Query.search conditions should suffice.

• **Pagination and Search:**  
  – Ensure that your search integrates well with pagination if that feature is enabled. This might involve passing along the last document reference (`lastVisible`) in subsequent calls.

• **Performance Considerations:**  
  – Monitor query performance with the added search filters. Full‑text search queries can sometimes affect performance if not indexed properly.

---

## Conclusion

By following these atomic steps—verifying full‑text indexes in your Appwrite database, extending the existing video fetching function to include search parameters, updating error handling, and conducting thorough testing—you’ll build a robust backend search feature. This will allow users to search through videos based on keywords present in both the title and description fields.

This plan touches on critical files such as `services/videos.ts` and your Appwrite configuration, ensuring that every technical detail is covered for clear, reliable implementation.
