Below is a detailed, step‐by‐step plan for a junior developer to add a simple "like" feature to your app. The plan is broken down into atomic steps. Critical files are highlighted, and pseudocode is provided where necessary. Follow each of these steps carefully:

---

## Step 1: Define the Desired Behavior

1. **User Interaction:**  
   - When the user taps the like button on a video, the like count should increase (optimistically) in the UI.
   - Only authenticated users can perform the like action.
   - (Optional) Prevent the same user from liking a specific video more than once. For now, you can assume a simple implementation where each tap increments the count.

2. **Backend Operation:**  
   - Update the like count of the video in the backend.
   - Create a record in the “likes” collection to represent the relationship between the user and the video (if needed for preventing duplicates later).

---

## Step 2: Identify Critical Files

1. **`services/firestore.ts` (or your Appwrite replacement service file):**  
   - This file holds functions that interact with your database.
   - A function like `batchUpdateLikes` should be created or expanded to update the like count for a video.

2. **`components/LikeButton.tsx`:**  
   - This component represents the UI button for liking a video.
   - It should receive the video data and a callback to update the local like count.

3. **`components/VideoItem.tsx`:**  
   - This component renders each video in the feed.
   - It should include the LikeButton and handle the state for the like count on that video.

4. **`store/index.ts` (if using Zustand for global state):**  
   - Although not critical for a minimal implementation, you may eventually want to update the global state when a like is added or removed.

---

## Step 3: Backend Update Flow (in *services/firestore.ts*)

1. **Create or Update the Likes-update Function:**

   - **Purpose:**  
     Accept a video ID, user ID, and a flag (e.g., `shouldIncrement`) to indicate whether the like is being added or removed.

   - **Steps in Pseudocode:**
     ```plaintext
     FUNCTION batchUpdateLikes(videoId, userId, shouldIncrement):
         IF userId is missing:
             RETURN error "User not authenticated"

         TRY:
             IF shouldIncrement:
                 // Optionally check if user already liked the video
                 // Create a new like record in the “likes” collection (if needed)
                 // Perform a database update to increment the likes count on the video document
             ELSE:
                 // For unliking, delete the like record and decrement the counter
             RETURN success indicator
         CATCH error:
             RETURN error with error message
     ```

2. **Critical Considerations:**
   - **Error Handling:** Ensure you capture database errors and return an error value.
   - **Optimistic Updating:** Even if the backend update is asynchronous, return promptly so the UI can respond immediately (and possibly roll back on error).

---

## Step 4: Create or Update the Like Button Component (in *components/LikeButton.tsx*)

1. **Component Responsibilities:**
   - Display the like count (or an icon with the like number).
   - Handle tap events.
   - Call the backend function (`batchUpdateLikes`) when the user likes a video.
   - Optionally adjust the UI state optimistically before receiving a response.

2. **Essential Logic Using Pseudocode:**
   ```plaintext
   ON likeButton PRESS:
       IF user is not authenticated:
           // Optionally show an error message or login prompt
           RETURN

       SET optimisticNewCount = current like count + 1
       CALL onLikeCountChange(optimisticNewCount) to update UI immediately

       CALL batchUpdateLikes(video.id, user.id, true)

       IF backend update returns error:
           // Revert the optimistic UI update
           CALL onLikeCountChange(current like count)
           LOG error message (or display a feedback message)
   ```

3. **Required Props:**
   - `video`: The video object that contains the current like count.
   - `onLikeCountChange`: A callback function that updates the like count locally in the parent component.

---

## Step 5: Integrate the Like Button into the Video Feed (in *components/VideoItem.tsx*)

1. **Render the Like Button within the VideoItem:**
   - Ensure that the VideoItem component, which displays the video content, also includes the LikeButton.
   - Pass the video’s current like count and a handler to update it as props.

2. **Steps for Integration:**
   - **Local State:**  
     Create local state in VideoItem for the like count (if not already managed globally).
   - **Pass Props:**  
     Pass down the video (with the current like count) and a setter function (or callback) to update the like count when a like occurs.
   - **UI Consideration:**  
     The LikeButton should be positioned alongside other actions (e.g., comments, sharing) displayed over the video.

---

## Step 6: (Optional) Update Global State if Needed

1. **When using Zustand:**
   - If you currently manage videos in a global store, ensure that an updated like count is reflected across your app.
   - You may add additional logic to update the global state inside the LikeButton’s callback or within VideoItem after a successful backend update.

---

## Step 7: Test and Verify the Implementation

1. **Local Testing:**
   - Run the app in development mode.
   - Tap the like button on a video and verify that the UI updates immediately (optimistic update).
   - Confirm that the updated like count is synced with the backend by checking your Appwrite dashboard (or your database if using another backend).

2. **Error Handling Testing:**
   - Simulate backend failures (by disconnecting the network or making the function return an error) and ensure that the UI reverts the changes and displays an error message if needed.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - Test that only authenticated users can like videos. If the user is not logged in, the like action should be ignored or prompt a sign-in flow.
   - Verify that the like count remains consistent when multiple users like the same video.

---

## Step 8: Document and Iterate

1. **Documentation:**
   - Update project documentation or technical notes to reflect how likes are implemented.
   - Clearly document the responsibilities of each critical file and function.

2. **Future Considerations:**
   - Consider adding functionality to unlike videos.
   - Implement measures to prevent double-liking by storing user-video relationships persistently.
   - Explore animations or a visual state change (e.g., toggling a heart icon) for improved user feedback.

Following this plan, a junior developer should have a clear roadmap for implementing a simple like feature in the app. Each step has been broken down into atomic parts, and the critical files are identified along with technical details to guide the implementation process.
